Created a default board (Waiting Board) for memebers when creating a new account.
    Did so because Having to create a new model (UserProfile) to use as a middle man for djangos
    built in Authentication's User Database. 

Added a signals.py model to allow for users created outside of the server to have a default profile
    Because server locks me out If I dont. Didnt know anyother way around if.
    This doesnt clash with the registration view that also creates a profile on account creation, and assigns it the Waiting Board.

    added signals to webpages.apps.py to complete the system that detects a new user being created outside of the server. (Potential security issue.) 

Added a message window to the Home screen that will be used to Update a users current task. Its not where I want it, but its there.

Added models to admin.py (User model not needed.) Registered them.

added:
    from . import models
to views.py, was needed to complete multiple things, and will be needed later.

Updated models to allow better admin site functionality, gave them names.
